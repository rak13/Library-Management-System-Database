### Consider a relational database model of your own and go for the following tasks.

1. Consider the database of at least 4 schemas/tables.

2. Plan for attributes that cover all general datatypes.

3. Plan for constraints of different types (primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, check, not null etc) with appropriate constraint names.

4. Create appropriate data for the above schemas.

5. Implement the database in Oracle 10g Express Edition creating a user.

6. Plan queries and find the answers (at least 10). 

7. Formulate everything in a report which includes:
	* Brief description of the system that you are going to implement in the database
	* Mention schemas with attributes
	* Expected functional dependencies on your schemas.
	* Proof of good database design so that the schemas are in good form (BCNF or 3NF)
	* Schema diagram of the database
	* E-R diagram of the database
	* Snapshots of SQL DDL of all the schemas/tables
	* Snapshots of the instances (data of the populated tables)
	* Query statements in English language, SQL statements and snapshots of the outputs. SQL statements should contain the following :

     - natural join, cross product, outer join, join with using, on 
     - nested sub-queries with clauses (some, all, any, exists, unique  etc.)
     - order by, group by, having clauses
     - Use of with  clause
     - Use of Functions (string/text, numeric) , set operations (union, intersect, difference/minus)
     - Update, delete operations
* Conclusion of the work
